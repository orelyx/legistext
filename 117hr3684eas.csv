190	20.5 - 20.12	TITLE I SEC. 11101.(e)(1)(A)	while significant progress has occurred due to the establishment of the disadvantaged business enterprise program, discrimination and related barriers continue to pose significant obstacles for minority- and women-owned businesses seeking to do business in Federally assisted surface transportation markets across the United States;
191	20.13 - 20.15	TITLE I SEC. 11101.(e)(1)(B)	the continuing barriers described in subparagraph (A) merit the continuation of the disadvantaged business enterprise program;
192	20.16 - 20.25	TITLE I SEC. 11101.(e)(1)(C)	Congress has received and reviewed testimony and documentation of race and gender discrimination from numerous sources, including congressional hearings and roundtables, scientific reports, reports issued by public and private agencies, news stories, reports of discrimination by organizations and individuals, and discrimination lawsuits, which show that race- and gender-neutral efforts alone are insufficient to address the problem;
193	21.1 - 21.9	TITLE I SEC. 11101.(e)(1)(D)	the testimony and documentation described in subparagraph (C) demonstrate that discrimination across the United States poses a barrier to full and fair participation in surface transportation-related businesses of women business owners and minority business owners and has impacted firm development and many aspects of surface transportation-related business in the public and private markets; and
194	21.10 - 21.16	TITLE I SEC. 11101.(e)(1)(E)	the testimony and documentation described in subparagraph (C) provide a strong basis that there is a compelling need for the continuation of the disadvantaged business enterprise program to address race and gender discrimination in surface transportation-related business.
